This document we are writing about the process of working on autopilot self-driving project. We have been working on training in the project with Convolutional Neural Network to predict steering angles using images taken by the simulator's center camera. The data imbalance in steering angles was addressed by plotting and evaluating the histogram, then enhancing dataset diversity using random flipping, brightness changes, and translations, which helped prevent overfitting and enhance generalization. During time completing this project, I and Tomi have faced some challenges in training, data processing steps and testing. There are many trainings environment setup, dependencies in package.txt file we have struggle in installing all required packages. When I set up the environment setup with TensorFlow GPU packages. The problem was solved by installing a CPU-compatible TensorFlow version with Python and matching NumPy to the required version. Another challenge was to provide smooth simulator inference. In testing steps, we create many different models to test the accuracy prediction. After many trials testing, we found the best model to submit this project.  <img width="468" height="271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3c5b7d7-5ec8-4bda-b7b8-7f478aa8968e" />
